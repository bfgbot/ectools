ectools is a small set of tools for managing EC2 instances, designed specifically for bfgbot use cases. The EC2 instance configuration is stored in the launch template. We typically manage between ten and a few hundred small instances. We launch new instances when starting a project and terminate them when the project ends. This library has proven very useful for launching and terminating these instances efficiently.
